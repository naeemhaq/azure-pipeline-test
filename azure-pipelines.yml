# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
- group: versions
  # define b as a counter with the prefix as variable a, and seed as 10.
- name: minor1
  value:  $[counter(variables['major1'], 10)]

- script: |
    echo $(minor1)
    echo $(major1)
  displayName: 'Minor version'

- script: |
    echo Add other tasks to build, test, and deploy your project.
